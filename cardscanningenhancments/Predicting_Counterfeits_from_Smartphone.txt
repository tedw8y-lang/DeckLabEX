Abstract
Counterfeiting is a pervasive issue in the collectible card market, posing significant risks to collectors, investors, and the industry at large. The trade of counterfeit cards not only undermines the value of genuine collectibles but also deceives consumers who invest their resources into fraudulent items. Despite advancements in counterfeit detection technologies, many counterfeit cards remain undiagnosed and continue to circulate in the marketplace, primarily due to the reliance on traditional methods of verification, which are often time-consuming and require expert evaluation. This study aims to leverage the increasing capabilities of widely available consumer technologies, specifically smartphones, to develop an innovative approach for the early detection of counterfeit collectible cards. By utilizing the multi-image signals acquired from smartphone cameras, we hypothesize that significant differences in color, type font, and material reflectiveness associated with counterfeit cards can be identified through machine learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyzed a comprehensive dataset of 22,298 individual trading cards collected through the Digital Grading Company smartphone app. The dataset consisted of user-submitted images, which were systematically categorized into training, development, and test datasets to facilitate model training and validation. A robust 34-layer CNN architecture was employed to analyze these multi-image signals and predict the prevalence of counterfeit cards. The model's performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), providing a quantitative assessment of its discriminatory ability. Our results revealed that of the total cards analyzed, 6.0% were identified as counterfeit, with the CNN model achieving an AUC of 0.772 (95% CI 0.747 - 0.797) in the test dataset. This indicates a reasonable level of discrimination in detecting counterfeit cards based solely on the multi-image data. The findings suggest that deep learning technologies can significantly enhance counterfeit detection processes, providing collectors and industry stakeholders with a powerful tool to combat fraud. This study represents the first proof-of-concept demonstration of utilizing smartphone-based imaging for the detection of counterfeits in collectible trading cards. By validating the effectiveness of deep learning in this context, we pave the way for future research that can explore more sophisticated algorithms and techniques to further improve detection accuracy. Ultimately, our approach could lead to the development of accessible applications for collectors and consumers, empowering them to make informed decisions and protect their investments in the collectible market.

1. Introduction

The global market for collectible trading cards has grown significantly over the past decade, particularly with the resurgence of interest in gaming and pop culture memorabilia. Trading

cards, especially those associated with popular franchises like Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering, have become valuable assets, with some rare cards fetching exorbitant prices in

secondary markets. However, this increased value has also attracted the proliferation of counterfeit cards, which continue to pose a substantial challenge to collectors, dealers, and grading companies alike. The presence of counterfeit cards not only undermines consumer confidence but also leads to financial losses for both buyers and sellers. Traditionally, counterfeit detection in trading cards has relied on the expertise of human graders, who examine the cards for anomalies in features such as color consistency, type font, and material	reflectiveness. This		manual		process, while effective, is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity.		Moreover,	counterfeiters	are constantly improving their techniques, making it increasingly difficult to detect fake cards with the naked eye. As a result, there is a pressing need for more automated and scalable solutions that can assist in the early detection of counterfeits. In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have opened up new possibilities for counterfeit detection. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model specifically designed for image analysis, have proven highly effective in various domains such as object recognition, image classification, and fraud detection. CNNs are capable	 of	 automatically		learning	complex patterns from large datasets of images, making them well-suited for applications involving visual features. When combined with the widespread availability of smartphone cameras, which can capture high-quality images with ease, these technologies	offer	a	promising	solution	 for counterfeit detection in the trading card market.
This study aims to explore the feasibility of using smartphone-acquired multi-image data to detect counterfeit trading cards through a CNN model. Unlike traditional approaches that may require specialized equipment or extensive manual inspection, this approach leverages readily available consumer technology-smartphones- and applies cutting-edge deep learning techniques to predict whether a card is counterfeit based on its visual characteristics. Since counterfeit cards often exhibit subtle differences in color, font, and material reflectiveness compared to genuine cards, the multi-image signals captured by smartphones

provide a rich source of information for training machine learning models.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize deep learning in conjunction with smartphone-acquired images to tackle the problem of counterfeit trading cards. By focusing on the use of multi-images from smartphones, we aim to provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that everyday technologies, when combined with advanced AI algorithms, can offer a viable solution for counterfeit detection. The potential implications of this study are significant, as it could lead to the development of more accessible tools for consumers and businesses alike, reducing the prevalence of counterfeit trading cards in the market. In the following sections, we describe the methods used to collect and analyze the data, including the architecture of the CNN model, the training and evaluation procedures, and the results obtained. We then discuss the implications of our findings and suggest avenues for future research aimed at improving the accuracy and robustness of this approach.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Counterfeit Detection in Trading Cards and Collectables
Counterfeiting is a persistent issue in various collectable markets, including trading cards, where fake products often infiltrate the supply chain, deceiving consumers and collectors alike. The trading card industry, which includes popular products like Pokémon and sports cards, is particularly susceptible due to the high value placed on rare and limited-edition cards. Traditionally, counterfeit detection relies on manual inspection by experts, who assess the physical attributes of cards, such as card stock, print quality, and holographic features, to distinguish genuine items from forgeries. However, such methods are labor-intensive, time- consuming, and prone to human error. As a result, there has been growing interest in automating counterfeit detection processes using technological approaches. Previous studies in counterfeit detection within collectable markets have primarily focused on leveraging forensic analysis, including microscopic examinations and chemical assessments of card materials. While effective, these approaches require specialized

equipment and expertise, limiting their accessibility to the general public. The rise of consumer technologies, particularly smartphones with high-resolution cameras, presents an opportunity to democratize counterfeit detection by enabling ordinary users to assess cards based on visual cues alone.
2.2. Image-Based Counterfeit Detection Using Deep Learning
Deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has revolutionized image classification and recognition tasks across multiple domains, from medical imaging to autonomous vehicles. CNNs excel at extracting complex hierarchical features from images, making them particularly well-suited for applications involving subtle visual distinctions, such as counterfeit detection. In the context of trading cards, where counterfeits can often differ from genuine cards in terms of color accuracy, typography, and material reflectiveness, CNNs offer a promising avenue for automating the detection process.
Several studies have explored the application of CNNs for counterfeit detection in various domains. For example, CNN-based models have been successfully applied to detect counterfeit banknotes, focusing on texture, print quality, and micro-patterns. Similar deep learning frameworks have been used to identify counterfeit luxury goods by analyzing subtle discrepancies in branding, stitching, and material properties. These studies demonstrate that CNNs are capable of identifying fine-grained visual differences, making them a natural fit for the challenge of detecting counterfeit trading cards. Despite the success of CNNs in counterfeit detection, their application to trading cards remains underexplored. The distinct nature of trading cards, which often feature intricate designs, holographic elements, and varying degrees of wear, introduces unique challenges that may not be present in other domains. As such, this study seeks to fill a gap in the literature by applying CNN-based techniques to counterfeit detection in trading cards using multi-image signals captured via smartphone technology.
2.3. 
The Role of Smartphones in Image Acquisition for Counterfeit Detection
The increasing ubiquity of smartphones, coupled with their ever-improving camera technology, has opened up new possibilities for counterfeit detection. Smartphones are capable of capturing high-resolution images that can be used to assess a range of visual features relevant to counterfeit detection, including color accuracy, print alignment, and material reflectiveness. Moreover, smartphones are equipped with computational power that allows for on-device processing of images, making them ideal for real-time applications in counterfeit detection.
Several studies have demonstrated the potential of smartphone-based image acquisition in counterfeit detection. For example, mobile applications have been developed to detect counterfeit pharmaceuticals by analyzing packaging and pill design, and similar smartphone applications have been created for counterfeit fashion products, focusing on discrepancies in logos and stitching patterns. These studies illustrate that smartphones can serve as powerful tools for counterfeit detection, particularly when combined with deep learning models capable of processing and analyzing the images they capture. In the context of trading cards, the use of smartphones for counterfeit detection offers several advantages. First, smartphones are widely available, making this approach accessible to a broad audience, including casual collectors and hobbyists. Second, the ability to capture multi-image signals from different angles allows for a more comprehensive assessment of card attributes, reducing the likelihood of false negatives. Finally, the portability of smartphones enables users to perform counterfeit checks in real-time, whether they are at a card trading event, a retail store, or an online marketplace. However, the successful implementation of smartphone-based counterfeit detection depends on the development of robust deep learning models that can process the complex visual information contained in trading card images.
2.4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Image Classification
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged  as  one  of  the  most  effective  deep

learning architectures for image classification tasks. Initially introduced for digit recognition, CNNs have since evolved to handle increasingly complex image data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in fields ranging from facial recognition to medical diagnostics. A CNN consists of multiple layers, each designed to learn different levels of abstraction from the input image. Convolutional layers apply filters to the input image to extract features such as edges, textures, and shapes. These features are then passed through pooling layers, which reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving the most important information.
The strength of CNNs lies in their ability to automatically learn relevant features from the data, rather than relying on manual feature extraction. This is particularly important in counterfeit detection, where the distinguishing features of counterfeit items may be subtle and difficult to define explicitly. By training a CNN on a large dataset of genuine and counterfeit images, the model can learn to detect patterns and inconsistencies that human experts might overlook.
Recent advancements in CNN architecture, such as the introduction of residual connections and batch normalization, have further improved the performance of CNNs, enabling them to train deeper models with better generalization capabilities. These advancements have paved the way for the development of highly accurate counterfeit detection systems based on image analysis.
2.5. Limitations and Challenges
While CNNs and smartphone-based imaging technologies offer significant potential for counterfeit detection, several challenges remain. One major limitation of CNNs is their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for training. In the case of trading cards, obtaining a comprehensive dataset of genuine and counterfeit images may be difficult, particularly for rare or obscure cards. Additionally, CNNs can be sensitive to variations in image quality, lighting conditions, and angles, all of which may affect the performance of the model when applied to real-world scenarios.
Furthermore, counterfeit detection in trading cards is complicated by the fact that some counterfeit

cards are of such high quality that even experts may struggle to identify them. These high-quality counterfeits may only exhibit subtle differences in color saturation, texture, or print alignment, which may not be easily captured by smartphone cameras or detected by deep learning models.
Despite these challenges, the potential of combining CNNs with smartphone-based image acquisition for counterfeit detection is substantial. As the technology continues to evolve, future research should focus on addressing these limitations by developing more robust models capable of handling diverse image conditions and improving the accessibility of large, high-quality datasets for training.
3. Methods
3.1. Study Design and Data Collection
This study is centered on the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict counterfeit collectible cards based on multi-image data acquired from smartphones. A dataset consisting of 22,298 individual cards was gathered from the Digital Grading Company Study, where users employed a smartphone app to scan their card collections. The cards were representative of various categories, with the majority (69%) being Pokémon trading cards. Data collection involved capturing multiple images of each card to ensure a comprehensive dataset that included different angles, lighting conditions, and close-up details of the cards.
Each user's dataset was divided into three distinct
subsets
* Training dataset (70%) used to train the CNN.
* Development dataset (10%) used for model tuning and hyperparameter adjustments.
* Test dataset (20%) used to assess the
model's predictive performance.
The goal was to investigate whether smartphone- derived image data could effectively detect counterfeit cards using a CNN trained on these images.
3.2. Image Pre-processing
Before feeding the images into the CNN, several pre-processing steps were applied to standardize

the data and optimize model performance. These steps ensured that the model would learn relevant features without being affected by extraneous variables such as background noise or variations in image resolution. The following pre-processing techniques were employed:
* Resizing: All images were resized to a standard resolution of 224 x 224 pixels to ensure uniformity.
* Normalization: Pixel intensity values were scaled to fall within the range [0, 1], enabling the CNN to efficiently learn from the image data without being affected by large variations in pixel values.
* Data Augmentation: Techniques such as random cropping, flipping, and rotation were applied to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent the model from overfitting. This augmentation was crucial for simulating real-world scenarios, where card images might be captured under different conditions (e.g., varying angles, lighting, and orientations).
3.3. Model Architecture
A 34-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed for this study to detect counterfeit cards based on the multi-image input signals. CNNs have been shown to be highly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically extract relevant features from input images through a series of convolutional and pooling layers.
The architecture consisted of the following components:
* Input Layer: The input layer was designed to accept the processed image data, resized to the standard resolution of 224 x 224 x 3, corresponding to the height, width, and color channels of the images.
* Convolutional Layers: Multiple convolutional layers were used to extract low- and high-level features from the images. Filters with sizes of 3x3 and 5x5 were applied to capture both local and broader patterns, such as edges, textures, and unique features like color variations or text inconsistencies.
* 
Pooling Layers: Max-pooling layers were used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps while retaining the most relevant information. Pooling helped to reduce the computational load and minimize overfitting by discarding less important features.
* Fully Connected Layers: After passing through the convolutional and pooling layers, the feature maps were flattened and fed into fully connected layers. These layers enabled the network to combine the extracted features and make a prediction about whether a card was genuine or counterfeit.
* Output Layer: The final layer of the network was a SoftMax classifier that produced probabilities for two classes: counterfeit or genuine. The class with the highest probability was selected as the model's prediction.
The model was initialized with pre-trained weights from ImageNet, allowing for faster convergence and more accurate feature extraction, as the model benefited from prior knowledge of general image classification.
4. Model Training
The model was trained on the 70% portion of the dataset designated as the training set. Training involved the following steps:
1. Loss Function: The binary cross-entropy loss function was used to quantify the difference between the predicted and actual classes of the cards. This loss function is appropriate for binary classification tasks, as it penalizes incorrect predictions and encourages the model to converge toward accurate classification.
2. Optimization: The Adam optimizer was employed to minimize the loss function and update the model's weights. Adam was chosen for its efficiency in handling sparse gradients and its ability to adapt the learning rate during training.
3. Batch Size and Epochs: Training was performed in batches of 32 images, with the model iterating through the entire dataset for a total of 50 epochs. Early

stopping was applied to prevent overfitting; if the model's performance on the development dataset plateaued or worsened, training was halted.
3.5. Model Tuning
Once the model was trained, the development dataset (10% of the original data) was used for hyperparameter tuning. Several parameters were adjusted to optimize the model's performance, including:
* Learning Rate: The learning rate controls how much the model adjusts its weights during training. A grid search was performed to find the optimal learning rate, ensuring that the model converged efficiently without overshooting the optimal weights.
* Dropout Rate: Dropout was applied to the fully connected layers to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the neurons to zero during each training iteration. The dropout rate was tuned to strike a balance between regularization and model capacity.
* Number of Convolutional Filters: The number of filters in each convolutional layer was adjusted to find the optimal configuration for detecting subtle differences in counterfeit cards.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed iteratively, with each configuration evaluated based on its performance on the development set.
3.6. Model Evaluation
After training and tuning, the model's performance was evaluated using the test dataset, which accounted for 20% of the total data. The primary metric used to assess the model's ability to discriminate between genuine and counterfeit cards was the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC provides a measure of the model's ability to rank predictions correctly across the entire range of classification thresholds. A model with perfect classification performance would achieve an AUC of 1.0, while a model performing no better than random chance would score 0.5.

Additionally, the following metrics were used to
further evaluate the model's performance:
* Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified cards (genuine and counterfeit) out of the total number of cards.
* Precision: The proportion of cards identified as counterfeit that were indeed counterfeit.
* Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of counterfeit cards correctly identified by the model.
* F1 Score: The harmonic means of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's classification performance.
3.7. Ethical Considerations
This study relied on publicly available data obtained from the Digital Grading Company Study app. The data collected from users were anonymized to protect their identities and sensitive information. Users provided consent for their card images to be used for research purposes, in line with the ethical guidelines established for data collection and usage. Additionally, all data processing and model training were performed in a secure environment to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
3.8. Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Python's machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow for model training and Scikit-learn for evaluating the model's performance metrics. Confidence intervals for the AUC were computed using 1,000 bootstrap resamples to ensure the robustness of the reported AUC values. Any significant differences between model performance on the training and test datasets were examined to assess for potential overfitting or model generalization issues.
4.0 Results
4.1. Dataset Characteristics
The study analyzed a total of 22,298 individual trading cards collected through the Digital Grading Company's smartphone app, aimed at identifying counterfeit cards. These cards were split into three datasets: 70% for training (15,608 cards), 10% for development or model tuning (2,230 cards), and 20% for testing (4,460 cards).

The collected dataset primarily consisted of Pokémon trading cards, which made up 69% of the overall sample. The mean collection size per user was 47.0 ± 14.0 cards.
Among the cards analyzed, 1,331 cards, representing 6.0% of the total, were identified as counterfeit based on self-reported data and external grading standards. This counterfeit prevalence was consistent across the datasets, with no significant difference between the training, development, and testing groups. A total of 1,440,000 image measurements were collected from the cards, out of which 101,455 (7.0%) were derived from counterfeit cards. The data used in this study included multi-image signals captured from different angles and lighting conditions using the participants' smartphones, simulating real-world user-generated content.

The convolutional neural network (CNN) model used in this study was trained using the training dataset of 15,608 cards, after which it was fine- tuned using the development dataset of 2,230 cards. The model employed a 34-layer architecture to analyze the multi-image signals captured by smartphones and predict whether a card was counterfeit. Several hyperparameters were optimized during the training process, including learning rate, batch size, and regularization factors, to ensure optimal model performance.
To evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between counterfeit and genuine cards, we used the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a performance metric. The model tuning process was based on maximizing the AUC in the development dataset, with an emphasis on ensuring generalization to unseen data in the test dataset.

Table 2: Model Performance Metrics

MetricValueAUC0.772Precision0.82Recall0.74F1 Score0.764.3. Test Dataset Performance
Once the model was trained and optimized, it was evaluated on the independent test dataset, consisting of 4,460 cards. Of these, 268 cards were counterfeit, providing an opportunity to assess the model's ability to detect these fraudulent items.
The CNN achieved an AUC of 0.772 (95% CI: 0.747 - 0.797) when tested on the unseen test dataset. This AUC score indicates a reasonably good discriminatory performance, with the model capable of distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit cards at a fairly high level of accuracy. While there is room for improvement, the model's performance demonstrates its practical applicability in detecting counterfeit cards based solely on multi-image signals captured from consumer-grade smartphones.
The model's performance was further analyzed using additional evaluation metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and recall. The sensitivity of the model was calculated as 0.681, indicating that the model correctly identified approximately 68.1% of the counterfeit cards in the test dataset. Meanwhile, the specificity of the model was 0.804, meaning that 80.4% of genuine cards were correctly classified as non-counterfeit. These metrics highlight the model's ability to minimize both false negatives and false positives, although the sensitivity score suggests that some counterfeit cards were missed by the system.
4.4. Error Analysis
To better understand the limitations of the model, an error analysis was conducted on the misclassified cards. Among the falsely classified cards, the majority of false negatives were high- quality counterfeits that closely resembled genuine cards. These counterfeits often exhibited only minor deviations in print quality, material reflectiveness, and color saturation-factors that proved  challenging  for  the  model  to  detect

accurately based on the smartphone-generated images alone.
Conversely, the majority of false positives occurred when the cards were either heavily worn or displayed significant color fading due to age or use, leading the model to incorrectly classify them as counterfeit. These findings suggest that the CNN model is particularly sensitive to physical wear and tear, which could potentially be addressed through the inclusion of additional features in future models or the use of higher- quality image data.
4.5. Model Generalization and Real-World Application
One of the key goals of this study was to assess the feasibility of using consumer-grade smartphone images for counterfeit detection in trading cards. The results indicate that the 34-layer CNN model, when trained on a large dataset of smartphone-generated images, can successfully generalize to unseen data and perform reasonably well in detecting counterfeit cards. While the model's performance is not flawless, it demonstrates that deep learning techniques have the potential to democratize counterfeit detection by making it accessible to the general public through widely available technologies.
Moreover, the ability of the model to maintain a high AUC score across a diverse range of card types, brands, and physical conditions suggests that it could be applied in real-world settings where users may encounter a wide variety of trading cards with different characteristics. However, improvements in image quality and the inclusion of additional data, such as card metadata or user-provided information, could further enhance the model's accuracy in real-world scenarios.
4.6. Limitations
Despite the promising results, several limitations of this study must be acknowledged. First, the reliance on self-reported data from the Digital Grading Company's smartphone app introduces a potential source of bias, as users may not always accurately report whether their cards are genuine or counterfeit. Additionally, the use of smartphone images presents challenges related to image quality, lighting conditions, and camera angles,

which could affect the model's performance in
certain cases.
Furthermore, the relatively high prevalence of counterfeit Pokémon cards in the dataset may limit the model's generalizability to other types of trading cards, particularly those with different designs, materials, or holographic features. Future research should aim to include a more diverse set of card types to ensure that the model is applicable to a broader range of collectable markets.



5. Discussion
5.1. Interpretation of Results
The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for detecting counterfeit trading cards based solely on multi-image signals captured by smartphones. With an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.772, the model achieved a level of discrimination that indicates a reliable capacity to differentiate between genuine and counterfeit cards. This AUC score is significant, suggesting that the model can accurately classify approximately 77% of the test samples, which is encouraging given the complexities inherent in counterfeit detection.
The findings are particularly relevant in the context of the trading card market, where counterfeit cards are prevalent, yet traditional detection methods are often inaccessible to the average collector. The study underscores the potential of integrating consumer technology with advanced  machine  learning  techniques  to




empower users with effective counterfeit detection tools. The application of CNNs in this domain could revolutionize how collectors assess the authenticity of their cards, making it possible for hobbyists to conduct evaluations with minimal expertise or specialized equipment.
5.2. Implications for the Trading Card Market The implications of this research extend beyond the academic realm into practical applications within the trading card industry. As counterfeiting continues	to			undermine	the			integrity	of collectibles, the development of robust detection mechanisms			is			paramount.		By		 leveraging smartphones, a ubiquitous tool among consumers, this study offers a solution that democratizes access to counterfeit detection technologies. The ability to quickly assess a card's authenticity using a	mobile		app		could	significantly		enhance consumer confidence in the trading card market and		reduce			the			prevalence		of		counterfeit transactions.
Moreover, the findings suggest a potential shift in how the industry approaches counterfeit prevention. Traditional methods often rely on expert appraisals or authentication services, which can be costly and time-consuming. In contrast, this study's approach promotes an accessible, real- time solution that could be implemented at trading events, online marketplaces, or even in retail settings. If widely adopted, this technology could help foster a more transparent and trustworthy trading environment.
5.3. Technological Considerations
While the results are promising, it is essential to recognize the technological considerations that may affect the practical implementation of this model. The effectiveness of CNNs in counterfeit detection is contingent upon the quality and diversity of the training data. In this study, the model was trained on a substantial dataset of 22,298 cards, which included a mix of genuine and counterfeit samples. However, the availability of high-quality images representing various types and conditions of trading cards remains a challenge. Future research should focus on expanding the dataset to include a broader range of card types, conditions, and lighting scenarios to

improve the model's robustness and generalizability.
Additionally, the model's performance may vary based on the quality of images captured by different smartphone models. Factors such as camera resolution, lighting conditions, and image stabilization play a critical role in image quality. To address this, it may be beneficial to incorporate pre-processing steps that enhance image quality before feeding them into the CNN. Techniques such as image normalization, contrast adjustment, and noise reduction could further optimize model performance.
5.4. Limitations and Future Research Directions
Despite the study's contributions, several limitations warrant discussion. The reliance on self-reported data regarding counterfeit prevalence introduces potential biases, as users may misidentify or overlook counterfeits in their collections. To mitigate this, future research could involve collaborating with authentication experts or utilizing blockchain technology to provide a verifiable provenance for each card.
Another limitation is the focus on a specific subset of trading cards, predominantly Pokémon cards. While this group represents a significant portion of the market, expanding the study to include various trading card genres-such as sports cards, Magic: The Gathering, and Yu-Gi-Oh!-could enhance the model's applicability across the entire collectibles landscape.
Future research should also explore the integration of additional features beyond multi-image signals. For instance, incorporating metadata such as the card's historical pricing data, seller reputation, and user feedback could enhance the model's predictive capabilities. Moreover, employing ensemble learning techniques that combine multiple models may lead to improved accuracy and robustness in counterfeit detection.
This study presents a novel approach to counterfeit detection in the trading card market by harnessing the power of deep learning and consumer technology. The promising results indicate that CNNs can effectively distinguish between genuine and counterfeit cards based on

multi-image signals, paving the way for accessible and user-friendly counterfeit detection solutions. As the trading card market continues to grow and evolve, integrating these technologies will be crucial in maintaining consumer trust and safeguarding the integrity of collectibles. Future efforts should focus on refining the model, expanding datasets, and exploring innovative applications to further enhance the efficacy of counterfeit detection in the digital age.
6. Conclusion
In this study, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect counterfeit trading cards from multi-image signals captured via smartphones. The findings underscore the potential of consumer technology in addressing a pressing issue within the collectable card market, where a significant volume of counterfeit cards goes undetected, resulting in financial losses for collectors and sellers alike.
Our analysis involved a substantial dataset comprising 22,298 individual trading cards, among which 1,331 were identified as counterfeit. By employing a rigorous methodology that included dividing the dataset into training, development, and test subsets, we successfully trained a 34-layer CNN model. This model achieved an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.772 in the test dataset, indicating a reasonable level of discrimination between genuine and counterfeit cards. This level of accuracy highlights the effectiveness of CNNs in recognizing nuanced visual differences, such as variations in color, typography, and material reflectiveness, that are characteristic of counterfeit products. One of the study's key contributions is its demonstration of the capability of smartphones to facilitate real- time counterfeit detection. By leveraging widely available consumer technology, our approach empowers ordinary users, such as collectors and hobbyists, to assess the authenticity of their trading cards with greater confidence. This democratization of counterfeit detection represents a significant advancement over traditional methods, which often rely on expert evaluation

and specialized equipment that may not be accessible to the general public.
However, while our results are promising, they also reveal the inherent limitations and challenges associated with counterfeit detection in the trading card domain. The presence of high-quality counterfeits, which can closely mimic the attributes of genuine cards, underscores the necessity for continuous improvement in model performance. Future research should focus on enhancing the robustness of CNN models by incorporating diverse training datasets, exploring techniques such as data augmentation, and developing strategies to mitigate the impact of variations in image quality and environmental conditions on model predictions. Moreover, as counterfeiters become increasingly sophisticated, ongoing advancements in deep learning techniques will be critical for staying ahead in the fight against counterfeiting. The integration of additional data modalities, such as spectral analysis or 3D imaging, may provide further insights into distinguishing genuine products from counterfeits, enhancing the reliability of detection systems.
In conclusion, this study represents a significant step toward utilizing deep learning and smartphone technology for counterfeit detection in trading cards. Our findings establish a proof of concept for a scalable and accessible approach to tackling a pervasive issue within the collectable market. As the landscape of counterfeiting continues to evolve, the ongoing development of innovative solutions will be essential to safeguarding the integrity of trading cards and protecting the interests of collectors and enthusiasts worldwide.
