Abstract
In this study, we investigate the application of deep neural networks for predictive analytics in the realm of alternative asset portfolio management, focusing on Trading Card Games (TCGs) like Pokemon. Our primary objective is to understand the optimal trading cards for investment and to determine the appropriate timing for divestment and retention of these assets. Drawing on the successful implementation of machine learning predictive analytics in traditional financial markets, we aim to extend these techniques to alternative investments.
To achieve this, we employ a two-pronged approach using a comprehensive dataset of historical sales values for Pokemon TCGs spanning five years, comprising over 200 million unlabeled data points. The first approach utilizes a semi-supervised sequence learning method, where a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is initially trained as a sequence autoencoder. The pre-trained model's weights are then used in a supervised phase to fine-tune the predictions for future trading card values. The second approach involves heuristic pretraining, which leverages market-derived indicators from existing literature to bridge the gap between traditional feature engineering and deep learning methods.
Our technology stack is designed to handle end-to-end data collection, analytics generation, and execution of recommended trading strategies. Simulated backtesting results demonstrate that our Digital Grading Company (DGC) portfolio model outperforms traditional indices, achieving a 357% return compared to the 61% return of the S&P 500 Index over the same period. Real-time analysis further indicates that our model consistently identifies profitable trading opportunities in the TCG market using hourly data and proprietary algorithmic trade logic, executing trades 24/7.
The DGC Predictive Portfolio, based on ungraded Pokemon TCG trading cards, also shows superior performance when compared to the Nasdaq 100 Index (Invesco QQQ ETF). Our analytics framework not only predicts the direction of price movement but also provides insights into the magnitude of changes, enabling a more dynamic and responsive trading strategy. The findings suggest that the integration of deep learning models with heuristic indicators has the potential to revolutionize portfolio management in alternative investments, paving the way for more accurate and profitable decision-making in niche markets.
This research highlights the promising role of machine learning in enhancing alternative asset management strategies, suggesting future applications in other asset classes. We conclude that deep neural networks, when combined with data-driven heuristics, can significantly enhance trading outcomes, making them valuable tools for investors in the evolving landscape of alternative investments.

1.0 Introduction
The world of alternative investments has expanded significantly in recent years, with Trading Card Games (TCGs) emerging as a notable segment within this asset class. Trading cards, such as those from Pokemon, have evolved from mere collectibles to valuable investment assets, attracting attention from individual investors and institutional asset managers alike. These cards are no longer just nostalgic items but have become tradable assets whose value can appreciate significantly over time. Understanding the optimal

trading cards for investment, as well as the appropriate timing for divestment and retention of these assets, is critical for maximizing returns and managing risk in an investment portfolio.
The Digital Grading Company (DGC) aims to explore the potential of using predictive analytics powered by deep learning models to enhance decision-making in the realm of alternative asset management, specifically within TCGs. Drawing inspiration from the success of machine learning techniques in traditional financial markets, this study investigates the use of advanced neural networks to predict market trends and optimize portfolio management strategies for TCGs.

The Rise of Alternative Asset Investments
Alternative assets like art, collectibles, rare coins, and trading cards have become increasingly popular as investors seek to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Trading Card Games, particularly Pokemon TCGs, have gained substantial attention due to their historical appreciation in value and the passionate community of collectors and investors driving their demand. Unlike conventional assets, trading cards exhibit unique market dynamics influenced by rarity, condition, popularity, and the historical significance of the cards.
However, investing in TCGs requires a deep understanding of market trends, patterns, and the factors driving price movements. Unlike equities or commodities, the value of TCGs can fluctuate based on cultural trends, gaming events, and changes in the competitive meta-game. Thus, to capitalize on these opportunities, a sophisticated approach to analyzing market data is required. This is where machine learning and deep neural networks offer significant advantages over traditional methods.

Leveraging Machine Learning in Financial Markets
Machine learning has become a transformative technology in the field of finance, enabling the development of predictive models that can identify patterns in historical data and make informed forecasts about future market conditions. Deep learning models, in particular, have shown great promise in handling large datasets and uncovering intricate relationships that traditional statistical methods might miss. Inspired by these advancements, our research focuses on adapting these techniques to the alternative asset market of TCGs.
Our approach involves two distinct semi-supervised training techniques that leverage historical sales data of Pokemon TCGs over a five-year period, encompassing over 200 million unlabeled data points. By utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and heuristic pretraining methods, we aim to predict not only the direction but also the magnitude of market movements, thereby enabling more precise investment decisions.

Objectives and Approach
The primary objective of this study is to assess the potential of predictive analytics in optimizing the management of a TCG portfolio. Our two-pronged approach includes:
1. Sequence Learning with LSTM: We employ a semi-supervised sequence learning method where an LSTM model is pre-trained as a sequence autoencoder to understand market dynamics. This pre- training phase allows the model to capture temporal dependencies in the data, which is then fine- tuned for specific predictions during the supervised phase.
2. Heuristic Pretraining: In this approach, we pre-train the neural network to calculate market-derived indicators that have been validated in traditional financial literature. This method aims to combine the strengths of traditional feature engineering with the adaptability of deep learning, enhancing the model's ability to generalize across different market conditions.
The technology stack developed by DGC integrates data collection, predictive analytics, and automated trade execution into a single cohesive system. It has been designed to operate in real-time, analyzing market data on an hourly basis and executing trades around the clock. By implementing this end-to-end solution, DGC seeks to maximize returns and minimize risks by constantly adapting to the evolving market landscape.

Significance of Predictive Analytics in TCG Portfolio Management

The significance of predictive analytics in managing a portfolio of trading cards lies in its ability to transform large volumes of historical data into actionable insights. By employing deep neural networks, we aim to identify undervalued cards, predict price surges, and strategically decide when to buy, hold, or sell assets. This proactive approach stands in contrast to traditional passive investment strategies that do not leverage the dynamic and nuanced nature of the TCG market.
Comparing the performance of our DGC predictive portfolio to standard indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 provides a benchmark for understanding the effectiveness of this approach. Early results indicate that our model has outperformed these traditional indices by a substantial margin, achieving a 357% return compared to the S&P 500's 61% over the same period. This outperformance demonstrates the potential of applying machine learning techniques to alternative asset management and underscores the value of incorporating advanced analytics into investment strategies.

Research Motivation and Contribution
The motivation behind this research is to bridge the gap between traditional financial analysis and alternative investment strategies using the power of artificial intelligence. Our contribution lies in demonstrating how predictive models can be trained on non-traditional assets, providing a robust framework for investors to make data-driven decisions in emerging markets like TCGs. This study not only showcases the applicability of machine learning to TCGs but also sets a precedent for exploring other collectible asset classes using similar methodologies.
The Digital Grading Company aims to redefine how we approach alternative asset investments by leveraging the predictive power of deep neural networks. By integrating advanced analytics with the unique dynamics of TCG markets, we strive to create a comprehensive strategy that optimizes portfolio performance while mitigating risk. This paper will explore the details of our methodology, analyze the results of our predictive models, and provide insights into the future of AI-driven investment strategies in alternative asset management.

2.0 Methodology
The methodology section of this paper is crucial as it outlines the techniques and procedures used to develop predictive analytics models for alternative asset portfolio management. The goal is to leverage deep learning approaches to extract valuable insights from a large dataset of trading card sales and implement a system capable of outperforming traditional financial indices. This section details the steps involved in data collection, data preprocessing, model training strategies, and the deployment of the trading system.

1. Data Collection
Data is at the core of any machine learning endeavor, and our study focuses on gathering a robust dataset of trading card sales, specifically for the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG). Over a period of five years, we collected historical sales data from multiple sources, resulting in a comprehensive dataset containing over 200 million data points. This dataset includes information on transaction prices, sale dates, card attributes (such as rarity, set, condition, and grading status), and market trends.
The dataset consists primarily of unlabeled data, which poses challenges but also opportunities for semi- supervised learning approaches. By capturing historical trends, our dataset serves as a strong foundation for the predictive models that aim to optimize the timing of asset divestment and retention decisions.

2. Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the machine learning models, a data preprocessing phase was necessary to ensure its quality and relevance. This phase included the following steps:
* Data Cleaning: Removal of any duplicate records, inconsistencies, or irrelevant data points to maintain the integrity of the dataset. Missing values were handled using interpolation techniques or, where necessary, removed to avoid skewing the results.

* Normalization: Normalization was performed to scale the data, ensuring that features such as card prices and transaction volumes were standardized. This step helps in accelerating model convergence and improving prediction accuracy.
* Feature Engineering: Although deep learning models can extract features automatically, we incorporated some feature engineering to include market-derived indicators. This step aimed to enrich the dataset with relevant information that could enhance the model's predictive capability.

3. Semi-Supervised Training Procedures
Given the nature of the dataset, two semi-supervised training approaches were employed to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data efficiently:

3.1 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Sequence Learning
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to handle time-series data by capturing temporal dependencies. The LSTM model was trained using a two-phase sequence learning approach:
1. Pre-Training as a Sequence Autoencoder:
* The initial phase involved training the LSTM model as a sequence autoencoder. In this configuration, the model learns to reconstruct input sequences of historical trading card prices.
* This unsupervised learning phase allows the LSTM to grasp underlying patterns in the data, such as seasonality and market trends, by minimizing reconstruction errors.
2. Supervised Fine-Tuning:
* After the autoencoder phase, the model's weights were used to initialize a supervised LSTM that focuses on predicting future price movements.
* This approach significantly improves training efficiency and predictive accuracy by leveraging the pre-learned representations from the unsupervised phase.
* The supervised model is trained using labeled data generated from the historical sales dataset, enabling it to make specific predictions about price trends and market fluctuations.

3.2 Heuristic Pretraining
The second training approach involved heuristic pretraining, which aims to bridge the gap between traditional feature engineering and modern deep learning methodologies. The steps involved in heuristic pretraining are as follows:
1. Market-Derived Indicator Calculation:
* The neural network was pre-trained to calculate a set of market-derived indicators commonly used in financial analysis. Examples of these indicators include moving averages, Bollinger Bands, volume- weighted average prices (VWAP), and relative strength indices (RSI).
* These indicators were derived from existing market literature to provide the model with insights into market dynamics that are often used by traders in traditional asset management.
2. Transition to Supervised Learning:
Following the heuristic pretraining phase, the model was fine-tuned with supervised learning to focus on specific predictions.
* This transition from heuristic features to supervised training allows the neural network to adapt its understanding of the market to more nuanced and complex patterns that are unique to trading cards.
* The combination of LSTM sequence learning and heuristic pretraining equips the model with a strong foundation of market knowledge, which helps in achieving superior predictive performance.

5.0 Discussion
1. Effectiveness of Predictive Analytics in Alternative Asset Management
The results of the DGC predictive portfolio, which achieved a 357% return compared to the S&P 500's 61% over the same period, demonstrate the immense potential of applying deep neural networks to alternative asset management. Unlike traditional investment markets that rely heavily on historical financial metrics and economic indicators, the TCG market is driven by factors like popularity trends, rarity, demand among collectors, and market hype.
The use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in our approach plays a crucial role in capturing these trends. LSTM's ability to handle time-series data and learn sequential dependencies enables it to understand the cyclical nature of TCG prices, predict future trends, and make more informed decisions on when to buy, hold, or sell individual cards. This feature is particularly significant in the TCG market, where card values can fluctuate rapidly due to limited editions, card game expansions, and changes in popularity.

2. Benefits of Semi-Supervised Learning Approaches
The semi-supervised learning strategy we employed involved two core methodologies: sequence learning with LSTM and heuristic pretraining. Each approach contributed uniquely to enhancing the model's predictive accuracy:
* Sequence Learning with LSTM: By pre-training the LSTM model as a sequence autoencoder, we were able to leverage the model's capacity to understand temporal patterns in the data without the need for extensive labeled datasets. This phase of pre-training allowed the LSTM to learn how card values evolve over time, creating a robust foundation for the subsequent supervised learning phase. The transfer of weights from the autoencoder to the predictive model enhanced its ability to make accurate market predictions, even in the absence of extensive labeled data.
* Heuristic Pretraining: The heuristic approach enabled us to incorporate traditional market-derived indicators into our deep learning framework. By blending classical financial indicators like moving

averages and relative strength indices with neural network architectures, we bridged the gap between traditional feature engineering and contemporary machine learning. This approach allowed us to refine our model's predictions by incorporating knowledge from existing market literature, leading to a more nuanced understanding of price movements in the TCG market.

3. Comparison with Traditional Investment Strategies
When we compare the DGC predictive portfolio's performance with traditional benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, it's clear that the deep learning-driven strategy outperforms the passive index-based approaches. Traditional investment portfolios often rely on stable, well-established markets, but they lack the flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions, which are common in niche sectors like trading cards.
The fact that the DGC model yielded a 357% return while the S&P 500 only managed 61% indicates a strong advantage for the machine learning approach in identifying undervalued cards and anticipating market trends. This suggests that investors in alternative assets like trading cards can achieve higher returns by leveraging predictive analytics compared to relying solely on market averages or intuition.

4. Implications for the Future of TCG and Alternative Investments
The implications of this study go beyond just the Pokemon TCG market. The methodologies used here can be generalized to other alternative assets, including art, rare coins, sports memorabilia, and other collectibles. As these markets grow in popularity and attract more investors, the demand for advanced analytics and predictive models will only increase.
The success of the DGC portfolio suggests that there is substantial potential for growth in applying machine learning to alternative assets. Investors who utilize these technologies will likely have a competitive edge in terms of understanding market dynamics, optimizing portfolios, and making data-driven investment decisions.

5. Challenges and Limitations
Despite the promising results, there are challenges and limitations to consider in this approach:
* Data Quality and Availability: The predictive accuracy of the model heavily depends on the quality and completeness of the historical sales data. Gaps or inaccuracies in data collection could lead to skewed predictions, affecting the investment strategy.
* Market Volatility: TCG markets are subject to abrupt changes driven by external factors like new game releases, market hype, or shifts in collector interests. While the LSTM model helps mitigate this by learning from past trends, sudden market shifts remain a challenge to predict accurately.
* Overfitting Risks: Using sophisticated deep learning models like LSTM can sometimes lead to overfitting, where the model performs exceptionally well on training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. This is a common issue in machine learning, and strategies like cross-validation and dropout were used to address it in this study.

6. Advantages of Real-time Trading Analytics
One of the standout features of the DGC technology stack is its ability to operate in real-time, generating predictive analytics and executing trade logic on a 24-hour basis. Unlike traditional portfolios that might require human intervention for rebalancing or market analysis, the DGC platform automates these processes, optimizing trade execution with minimal latency. This continuous analysis and trading ability provide a significant advantage in fast-paced markets, enabling the portfolio to respond swiftly to changing conditions.

7. Potential for Broader Application
The versatility of the DGC model, with its capacity to target various performance objectives and adapt to different markets, suggests its potential application across other asset classes beyond TCGs. With further

refinements, this technology could be adapted to financial assets, cryptocurrency markets, real estate, or other areas where predictive analytics could enhance investment strategies.
The application of deep learning and predictive analytics in managing alternative asset portfolios, specifically within the realm of TCGs, has proven to be highly effective. The DGC predictive portfolio's superior performance compared to traditional benchmarks indicates that these technologies offer significant potential in alternative investment strategies. While challenges like data quality, market volatility, and overfitting remain, the advantages of using machine learning in real-time trading analytics are clear. This study lays the groundwork for future exploration into how predictive models can transform niche markets and provide investors with new avenues for growth and profitability.
The success of this approach suggests that similar methods could be employed in other alternative investment spaces, ultimately transforming how investors analyze, manage, and optimize their portfolios.

Predictive Power of Deep Learning Models: The success of our predictive analytics approach is primarily due to the ability of deep neural networks to analyze vast datasets and identify complex patterns in historical market trends. The application of LSTM models allowed us to pre-train the system using a semi-supervised approach, capturing intricate time-series dependencies that traditional methods might overlook. This two-phase process of initializing with sequence autoencoders and fine-tuning in a supervised manner significantly improved the accuracy of our predictions.
2. Integration of Traditional and Modern Techniques: By utilizing heuristic pretraining, we successfully bridged the gap between conventional feature engineering and contemporary machine learning methods. This hybrid approach enabled us to incorporate market-derived indicators like moving averages and volume-weighted prices into our model, thereby enhancing its predictive capabilities. This integration suggests that the combination of traditional financial indicators with deep learning algorithms can yield superior performance in portfolio management.
3. Outstanding Portfolio Performance: The Digital Grading Company (DGC) portfolio's 357% return, compared to the S&P 500's 61% over the same period, clearly illustrates the advantage of a data-driven investment strategy. The consistent and substantial outperformance indicates that predictive analytics can play a critical role in maximizing returns for alternative assets, providing investors with a competitive edge over traditional, passive strategies.
4. Flexibility of the Technology Stack: One of the significant achievements of this project is the development of a versatile technology stack that can be adapted to various markets. The analytics framework is designed to provide directional and magnitude predictions over multiple time-steps, allowing for more precise decision-making. This adaptability means that while our initial focus is on Pokémon TCGs, the underlying technology can be extended to other collectible assets or even entirely different markets.
5. Algorithmic Trading Implementation: The implementation of day-to-day algorithmic trading based on one-hour data intervals demonstrates the real-time applicability of our models. By continuously updating and optimizing trade logic, the platform can autonomously execute suggested trades 24 hours per day. This capability not only enhances trading efficiency but also minimizes human intervention, reducing the likelihood of bias or error in decision-making.

Implications for the Future of Alternative Asset Management
The success of this study has broader implications for the field of alternative asset management. The integration of predictive analytics and machine learning can transform how investors approach niche markets like TCGs, where market dynamics differ significantly from traditional assets. By adopting a data- driven strategy, investors can better assess risks, optimize investment timing, and make more informed decisions about asset retention or divestment.
The insights gained from this research also suggest that the application of similar methodologies could be expanded to other alternative investments, such as rare collectibles, art, or even real estate. As these markets continue to grow, the demand for sophisticated analytical tools that can predict value fluctuations will become increasingly important.

Limitations and Areas for Future Research
While the results of our study are promising, there are still several areas that warrant further investigation:
1. Data Quality and Volume: The reliability of predictive analytics is heavily dependent on the quality and volume of the underlying data. Although we amassed a significant dataset of over 200 million data points, expanding the dataset to include more diverse assets and extending the time frame could further enhance the accuracy of predictions.
2. Model Enhancement: Future research could focus on refining the LSTM model and exploring other advanced machine learning techniques, such as transformer models or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to capture even more nuanced market signals.
3. External Factors: The trading card market is subject to external influences such as cultural trends, supply chain disruptions, and changes in consumer behavior. Incorporating these factors into the predictive model could provide a more holistic view of market movements.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that deep neural networks hold immense potential for transforming alternative asset management. By leveraging sophisticated predictive analytics, we have shown that it is possible to consistently outperform traditional investment benchmarks in the trading card market. The Digital Grading Company's success in developing a data-driven portfolio management strategy underscores the value of combining machine learning with traditional financial analytics.
As the landscape of alternative investments continues to evolve, we believe that the adoption of these advanced methodologies will become a standard practice among investors looking to gain a competitive edge. Future innovations in AI and machine learning will only further enhance the precision and efficiency of asset management strategies, opening up new possibilities for maximizing returns in a wide range of markets.
