**"You are working on DeckLab TCG, a Pokemon TCG management app built with Expo/React Native and TypeScript. The project structure is complete but features are not functional and assets are not loading from the database.**

*
**GOAL:**
Transform this from a UI mockup into a fully functional Pokemon TCG app with real data loading, working features, and proper database integration. Focus on making the core functionality work first, then enhance with advanced features.

**Start by fixing the Pokemon TCG API service to make real API calls and load actual card data, then move to Firebase integration for user data and collections.**"

Please assume nothing and even assume the build is not correct, Use Web to look up competitors like, Collectr, digitialgradi.ai, rarecandy, and mintcollect. 

you can use this description to help you but still look at the entire project like you know nothing to be unbiased and ensure completness and perfection 

there should be no place holders or mock data anywhere in this project that was an unbreakable rule i should inform you of. also insure you did not take away any functionality or downgraded my app build in any way. this is a very complex app and deserve attention to detail. I need you to include in your tasks which should take priority first is to index ever sing file then update  to ensure completeness also i notice another file that has the same name and  this should be only one file to ensure no confusion. assume nothing is correct and comprehensivly review each file in every subdirectory independently. skip nothing that is another unbreakable rule im giving you. i expect you to take your time and pay attention to all details in our code and cross reference WEB to see if you can improve or enhance our current build with latest code/project examples, utilize github and anyother code resourse and Code data/official documentation. also ensure no duplicates and make sure everything is tailored to our build to excced our current competitors like Collectr and Rarecandy for TCG collection and value tracking. I want you to focus on Collectr because that is the top ranked app right now in this industry, i want you to list out all features and services and function and even screenshots of the app and make it the exact same as our base and then we tailor it to the name Deck lab where we include features not only for collectors but also TCG competitive players. i want you to make an updated app description and other business level documentation to fully explain this application to its fullest and completeness to ensure clear communicative verbose on our build and why this will be the best TCG app on the market. include a suggestion file as well for improvements and enhancements you feel would even further our stance and claim on being the number one TCG app for collectors and competitive players. also create a resources file where we keep all of our resources that we use or plan to use or even reference. i will include an app description of what i had in mind at first i want you to further update that as well as now its outdated because im focusining on adding enhancemnets for Competitve TCG players as well. 

## Project Name: DeckLab Bolt

## Project Overview

**Mission:** To create the most advanced, intuitive, and comprehensive Pokemon TCG management platform that bridges the gap between physical collecting and digital innovation, providing users with unprecedented tools for collection management, market intelligence, and community interaction.
 A cross-platform app (iOS/Android/Web) for collectible card game enthusiasts. It focuses on Pok√©mon TCG but equally supports other major franchises (Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Disney Lorcana, etc.). The app offers a comprehensive card database with set-by-set browsing (by region/release), multi-language support (English, Japanese, Chinese, etc.), and advanced search/filter. Users can browse sets or even a Pok√©mon ‚ÄúPok√©dex‚Äù view grouping cards by species and evolution chains. Detailed set pages display set logos, total card counts, progress (owned vs. total), and set value. Cards can be filtered by attributes like rarity, illustrator, color/type, price range, or card number. All card data (names, images, stats, flavor text) is pulled from authoritative sources (e.g. Pok√©mon TCG API, Scryfall, YGOPRODeck, etc.) for up-to-date data and high-res images.

**Vision:** To be the industry standard for Pokemon TCG enthusiasts, offering a seamless, powerful, and engaging experience that elevates their collecting and playing journey.

Card Databases

	‚Ä¢	https://pkmncards.com
 		Pokemontcg.io
Ebay api for market data and PSA pop reportsPlease ensure the search is the main feature and Home Screen of the app. I want it to display all the sets with the set logos from the pokemontcg.io and then when you click on the set is displays the card list of pokemon default organized by the typing of the pokemon and just like https://www.justinbasil.com/visual/ss11 and then there is a sort and filter button at the top left in modern swift ui design using WWDC design tips. Also when you click on a card it displays all the data on the card like raw and graded prices, population reports for each grading company as well. And then fair good and best prices for cards. Also listings for the card on eBay as well both raw and graded versions when you click on the option it pulls form the bay api, also the charts, portfolio data, and any pre grading results if you have that card. It should show the card art at the top at all times and when you click on it is how you access the live card model view with our holographic shaders that utilize the gyroscope with pinch to zoom and other features make it perfect like your holding the card  and the live model view like collectr examples in the screenshots . Also add these sources to our data base and try to make tabs for news and information etc. https://www.justinbasil.com/external
For the card scanning feature I want it to scan cards when they get into focus after 2 seconds automatically or if the user has it in manual mode when they tap anywhere on the screen. the Overlay blurs out everything except a window the size of a card so our system only captures and processes  the information on the card. Users can see the estimated value of each card and the grand total of the current scan session. From there users can select to add it to main collection and or one of the custom lots they make like sell, trade, and or even add to binder service as well. Or if users batch scan they can make a running list that they can utilize for price checking current cards infront of them so they can understand how to organize them. The AI personal assistant should be able to utilize the information of the cards being scanned in to help you with any tasks or questions that are within its capabilities of handling for things like organization, price data, population reports, full data charts on the specific card for value tracking and price history and even projection based on user popularity. the users can sort filter and organize cards by rarity, price, card number, date added, English, Japanese, Chinese, holo, non holo, full art, etc. this gives the user powerful tools and abilities to do anything quickly to  ensure they are efficient.when users toggle to pre grading in the camera scanner the overlay is the same and the photos that are required to generate a report will be empty and as you scan each requested one in it will put the photo below until all photo requirements are met with proper lighting and quality to ensure best results and then users can press Submit for pregrading as it will turn into an actionable button when all photos are input.  The pre grading is a multi capture system to ensure accuracy and proper pre grading reports that are exactly the same as TAG grading.  Utilize the website and copy it exactly as it is even with the slider for the surface details to show imperfections and all report information. you will also include reports not only by TAG standards but for PSA, Beckett,  and CGC, and even AGS. ill include two reports of a Gyarados Gold star in different grades for you to understand more specific how they handle grading and how they grade. please include information like this in another file with these references to make sure future AI assistants understand what i want and need just in case  
https://my.taggrading.com/card/W7283117 
https://my.taggrading.com/card/L4746302
 for the live card model make sure its a fully physics-based, holographic foil shader that utilizes gyroscope to provide an AR type of feel to the cards when the card art is pressed. 
Each pixel simulates a ray of light diffracting into a rainbow of waves, which add and subtract to create these incredible patterns.
Not a single gradient should be used.
ensure you handle this update systematically so you dont miss anything or any detail. review this prompt as much as needed to ensure you understand and finish all task given to completeness

Please use any and all opensource resources, libraries and databases for our build. 

also take this into account as well for our UI 
React Native UI Frameworks & Design Inspiration

To achieve a modern, award-winning UI for DeckLab Bolt on Expo (iOS, Android, Web), we should build on proven open-source React Native libraries and best practices. Leading UI kits like Gluestack UI (formerly NativeBase), Tamagui, React Native Paper, UI Kitten, React Native Elements, and Shoutem UI offer polished, customizable components that work cross-platform. For example, Gluestack/UI provides 30+ prebuilt components with Tailwind-like styling, and Tamagui is a high-performance system optimized for complex designs Ôøº Ôøº. React Native Paper (Material Design) supports light/dark theming, and UI Kitten (Eva Design) supports RTL languages ‚Äì both are Expo-compatible and production-ready Ôøº Ôøº. These libraries reduce boilerplate and ensure platform-consistent widgets (buttons, cards, forms) out of the box.

For animations and interactive effects, Expo bundles Reanimated (version 3/4) which enables smooth, native-driven animations Ôøº. We should also use Lottie (react-native-lottie) for high-quality vector animations and micro-interactions (confetti, sparkles, pack-opening effects) Ôøº. Core UI/UX libraries (React Navigation for screen routing, Expo Router or React Router for web) should be used for consistent navigation. Iconography can come from open sets like react-native-vector-icons or the built-in Ionicons/Material icons. Expo also supports shopify/react-native-skia for custom GPU-accelerated graphics (ideal for the holographic ‚ÄúLive Card‚Äù shaders and 3D effects) Ôøº. Altogether, using these open-source tools ensures DeckLab Bolt‚Äôs UI can be highly polished, themeable (e.g. a dark-mode design with bright ‚ÄúPok√©Yellow‚Äù accents), and maintainable by a React Native dev team.

Importantly, we follow platform guidelines: apply Material Design heuristics for Android and Apple‚Äôs Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for iOS. As one guide notes, ‚Äúit‚Äôs essential to follow the design guidelines for each platform‚Äù to achieve a native look and feel Ôøº. For example, use ample touch targets, responsive flex layouts, clear visual hierarchy, and subtle transitions Ôøº Ôøº. Apple Design Award winners emphasize fluid animations, depth effects, and haptics. The ADA-winning ‚ÄúDenim‚Äù app, for instance, uses ‚Äúsmooth scroll transitions and elegant text and mesh gradients‚Äù plus custom haptic feedback and depth animations to create an engaging experience Ôøº. We should similarly integrate dynamic gestures, transitions, and feedback. (In short: treat DeckLab Bolt like a polished Apple Prize contender ‚Äì smooth, lively, and intuitive.)

Finally, modern UX encourages gamification and personalization. DeckLab Bolt can learn from apps like Duolingo (an ADA winner) which reward users, adapt difficulty, and sprinkle playful animations. While Duolingo isn‚Äôt a TCG app, it shows how ‚Äúpunctuated‚Äù progress markers and fun UI can boost engagement. We will incorporate achievement badges, progress bars, and interactive tutorials (‚Äúsparkle‚Äù when a set is completed, congratulatory animations, etc.) to make collecting addictive.

Key UI Libraries (Open Source)
	‚Ä¢	Component Libraries: Gluestack (NativeBase) Ôøº, Tamagui Ôøº, React Native Paper Ôøº, UI Kitten Ôøº, React Native Elements Ôøº, Shoutem UI Ôøº. Each offers theming, cross-platform support, and a rich set of components (buttons, lists, cards, modals). For example, Gluestack and Tamagui are highly customizable and maintain performance even with complex UIs.
	‚Ä¢	Animation Libraries: React Native Reanimated (Expo‚Äôs default) for physics-based animations and transitions Ôøº. Lottie for lightweight vector animations (e.g. pack-opening or swipe animations) Ôøº. Moti or React Native Animatable could also be used for simpler declarative animations.
	‚Ä¢	Graphics & Effects: React Native Skia (Shopify) for custom shaders and the ‚Äúholographic‚Äù live card effect Ôøº. Expo supports sensors like expo-gyroscope and expo-haptics to enable gyroscope-driven tilt and vibration feedback when viewing cards. react-native-gesture-handler and react-native-redash for smooth pan/zoom interactions (especially on the ‚ÄúLive Card‚Äù zoomable image).
	‚Ä¢	Charts: Use Victory Native or react-native-chart-kit for price/portfolio charts. Victory supports animated, themeable charts and works with Skia (it now depends on Reanimated, Gesture Handler, and Skia for high-performance updates) Ôøº Ôøº. It easily renders line, bar, and pie charts with animations. Alternatively, react-native-svg-charts or react-native-gifted-charts could be used for simpler needs.
	‚Ä¢	Other Tools: expo-camera for scanning and photo capture. react-native-permissions if needed for camera access. React Native Gifted Chat for any in-app messaging or chat features Ôøº. expo-clipboard, expo-file-system, expo-web-browser for sharing and external links. Redux Toolkit or Zustand for state management (especially to sync user data across screens) and TypeScript typesafety across the codebase.

By combining these libraries, we can rapidly build a visually impressive app while maintaining full control over style and performance.

Feature-by-Feature UI & Screen Layout

Below is a proposed breakdown of every major feature and its UI/UX flow. Each screen uses live data (no placeholders) and maximizes platform guidelines for a polished, intuitive experience.

1. Onboarding (Welcome + Tutorial)
	‚Ä¢	Welcome Screen: A fullscreen welcome view (e.g. DeckLab logo, tagline) with an elegant animated background or card motif. A prominent ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù or ‚ÄúLog In / Sign Up‚Äù button leads onward. Possibly a quick animated transition or parallax effect.
	‚Ä¢	Walk-through Tutorial: Carousel or paged tutorial screens highlighting key features (e.g. ‚ÄúScan your cards‚Äù, ‚ÄúManage collections‚Äù, ‚ÄúTrack market prices‚Äù). Use large, colorful illustrations (e.g. blurred card art) and minimal text. Include skip and back/next navigation, with progressive page indicators. Use smooth fade/slide animations between pages. Ensure typography and images meet dynamic type (large fonts, high contrast).

Implementation: Use a modal or initial navigation stack (WelcomeScreen followed by OnboardingScreen1,2,...). Each slide uses library components (cards, text). Persist a flag in local storage so walkthrough only shows on first launch.

2. Authentication & Profile
	‚Ä¢	Login / Sign-Up: Clean, simple form screens. Use secure text inputs for email/password (filled icons like user, lock). Offer social logins (e.g. Google) if desired (using Expo AuthSession). Show error messages inline (e.g. ‚ÄúInvalid email‚Äù). Use the app‚Äôs accent colors for buttons.
	‚Ä¢	Password Recovery: Separate screen/modal to input email for reset. Confirm success or errors.
	‚Ä¢	Profile Screen: Accessible after login (in a ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù tab). Displays user avatar, name, and stats (e.g. total cards, collection value, badges). Options include editing profile picture/name, toggling privacy, and managing premium subscription. Provide a ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù section: notification preferences, app theme (light/dark), language, etc.

Implementation: Use form libraries (e.g. Formik) for validation. Securely manage auth state globally (React Context/Redux). Profile picture selection via expo-image-picker.

3. Home / Search Screen (Main Feature)
	‚Ä¢	Search Bar / Quick Filters: At top, a search input with placeholder like ‚ÄúFind cards or sets‚Ä¶‚Äù. Include a filter button (top-left) that opens an advanced filter modal. Use icons (search, filter) from vector-icons.
	‚Ä¢	Sets Grid/List: Display all Pok√©mon TCG sets (via pokemontcg.io API) with set logos and names in a grid or list. For cross-platform, a 2- or 3-column FlatList grid with large set icons and set title underneath. Show release date or region subtitled. Provide an ‚ÄúAll Sets‚Äù section followed by separate sections for Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh!, etc. (multi-TCG support). Each set card uses a clean Material-style card or outline.
	‚Ä¢	Filter/Sort Button: At top-left, a ‚ÄúSort & Filter‚Äù button (e.g. funnel icon). On tap, slide in a modal panel with filtering options (franchise, region, languages, card type, rarity, price range, etc.). Each filter uses checkboxes or sliders. Ensure the panel looks modern (semi-transparent blur behind, card edges). Use toggles for common filters.
	‚Ä¢	Popular/Recent Sets: Optionally above the grid, a horizontal scroll of ‚ÄúPopular‚Äù or ‚ÄúRecently Released‚Äù sets with badges. Animations when swiping.

Citing Inspiration: The JustinBasil ‚ÄúVisual Set List‚Äù uses a clean grid of set logos and cards Ôøº. We emulate that polished style (grid with high-quality images, responsive layout).

Implementation: Use FlatList with numColumns={2} for grid. Navigate to SetDetailScreen on tap.

4. Set Detail (Card List)
	‚Ä¢	Header: Show the set‚Äôs large logo or graphic at top, plus title, release date. Background could be a blurred version of the logo (dark overlay).
	‚Ä¢	Set Stats: Below header, display total cards in set, owned vs missing count, and total set market value. Use horizontally arranged badges or info cards. Include a progress bar or donut chart for ‚ÄúSet Completion‚Äù. A small spark animation when first completed.
	‚Ä¢	Card List by Type: Show cards grouped by type/category. For Pok√©mon sets, default to ‚ÄúPok√©mon‚Äù section first, then ‚ÄúTrainers‚Äù, ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù etc. Within each section, list cards in order (or allow sorting by number, rarity, or price). Use a subheading (type icon + name). Each card entry is a horizontally laid-out row with thumbnail (card art), name, rarity, and small indicator if owned. Or a grid of thumbnails (like the JustinBasil visual list) with the card image and card number overlay.
	‚Ä¢	Sorting/Filtering Controls: At the top (below header), provide a segmented control or dropdown to quickly filter card type (similar to iOS segment). Already have ‚ÄúSort & Filter‚Äù button from home. Also allow pull-to-refresh to update live data.

Citing Design: The JustInBasil grid illustrates grouping by type Ôøº. The UX should mimic a modern ‚ÄúPok√©dex‚Äù or ‚Äúalbum‚Äù ‚Äì clean rows or grids with crisp thumbnails, ample white (or dark) space, and consistent margins.

Implementation: Likely a SectionList grouping by card type. Thumbnails use high-res card art (lazy-loaded). Tapping a card goes to CardDetailScreen.

5. Card Detail Page
	‚Ä¢	Hero Image: Show the card‚Äôs front image fullscreen (or within a top half container). Support pinch-to-zoom. Below or overlay a translucent toolbar with ‚Äúback‚Äù and ‚Äúflip‚Äù buttons (for back image). Clicking the card image enters the ‚ÄúLive 3D Model‚Äù mode (see below).
	‚Ä¢	Info Section: Under the image, list card details: set name/number, category (Pok√©mon/Trainer/Energy), rarity icon, HP/Stats, evolution family (for Pok√©mon) or card text/flavor. Each attribute can be a row with icon (e.g. energy symbol, illustrator icon). Use collapsible panels or tabs if too much info.
	‚Ä¢	Market Data: Prominently display current price range: raw vs graded. Show three values: ‚ÄúFair‚Äù, ‚ÄúGood‚Äù, ‚ÄúBest‚Äù (market quotes) for raw and separately for PSA/BGS cards. Underneath, an interactive price history graph (via Victory or chart-kit) for the selected card. Also display PSA/Beckett population reports (e.g. ‚ÄúPSA Population: 20/ 100, etc.‚Äù). Possibly use small tiles or list items.
	‚Ä¢	External Links: Buttons or list items linking to eBay searches (raw/graded), CardMarket, TCGPlayer for purchases. Tap opens WebBrowser or integrated list.
	‚Ä¢	Ownership Controls: If user toggles ‚ÄúOwned‚Äù, show controls for quantity, condition (dropdown: Mint/NM/Lightly Played/etc.), whether foil, personal cost. Buttons: ‚ÄúAdd to Collection‚Äù, ‚ÄúMark for Trade/Sale‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdd to Wishlist‚Äù. Use color-coded tags (green for owned, orange for wishlist). These controls use the same style as common forms (pickers, steppers).
	‚Ä¢	Alternate Variants: If card has alternate print/art or other language editions, present a horizontal scroller showing those card images as tiles; tapping one switches the main info to that variant.

Citing Details: We incorporate all specified elements (edition info, illustrator, rulings, etc.) in a clean vertical list. The market graph and data align with ‚ÄúMarket Data & Pricing‚Äù requirements. We keep the card art visible at all times, as requested, with a persistent image header.

Implementation: Use a scroll view. Chart from Victory Native (animated). Buttons trigger API calls for eBay data. The ‚Äúflip‚Äù animation can be a Reanimated 3D flip effect.

6. Collection Management
	‚Ä¢	Collections List: A main ‚ÄúCollections‚Äù tab shows all user collections (e.g. ‚ÄúMy Pok√©mon Set‚Äù, ‚ÄúLegacy Cards‚Äù, ‚ÄúFor Sale‚Äù, etc.). Each is a card showing collection name, count, total value, maybe a progress bar. Include a ‚Äú+ Create Collection‚Äù button (with a modal form for name and icon color).
	‚Ä¢	Collection View: Selecting a collection shows its card contents, similar to Set Detail layout. Provide sort/filter (by date added, price, rarity, language, holo status, etc.). Thumbnails of cards can be grouped or listed. Show summary stats: total unique cards, total count, total current market value vs total purchase cost. Possibly a mini-chart of value over time (if tracking purchase history).
	‚Ä¢	Add/Edit Card: Within a collection, an ‚ÄúAdd Card‚Äù button opens a form to manually add a card (search/select card by name/ID, input quantity, condition, price paid, notes, photo). Existing cards list each entry with quantity and condition tags. Swiping a card entry reveals ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù and ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù actions (or use an Edit screen).
	‚Ä¢	Bulk Actions: Allow bulk import (e.g. enter a number of cards or scan multiple codes) and bulk edit (multi-select to change location/trade tags).
	‚Ä¢	Set Completion Tracking: When viewing a set within a collection context, visually mark owned cards versus missing ones (e.g. grayed silhouettes for missing).

Citing Need: This covers all ‚ÄúCard & Collection Management‚Äù features. The UI must be rich and flexible (far beyond Collectr‚Äôs basic flows). For example, instead of simple lists, use cards with colored badges and interactive charts. Always allow real data editing (no placeholders or TODO prompts).

Implementation: Use Redux or Context for collection state. Persist to local storage or synced backend. Use expo-sqlite or AsyncStorage for offline data.

7. Binder (Virtual Album)
	‚Ä¢	Binder View: Emulate a real binder page: show an empty 3√ó3 or 6√ó3 grid (‚Äú9-card‚Äù or ‚Äú18-card‚Äù page). Each slot can hold a card image. Missing slots show a gray silhouette. Users can flip through pages with swipe gestures. A page-turn animation (using Skia or Reanimated) adds realism.
	‚Ä¢	Drag-and-Drop: Enable dragging a card (from collection or search results) onto a binder slot. Use React Native Draggable FlatList or PanResponder to implement drag. Provide smooth physics and snap-to-slot.
	‚Ä¢	Animations: Use 3D perspective effects for page turns (slight rotation) and a subtle shadow between pages. Tapping a card on the binder opens its detail popup (show card info on overlay). Hover (on web) or long-press (on mobile) could show quick stats tooltip.
	‚Ä¢	Sharing: Allow exporting a binder page as an image or sharing via link. ‚ÄúShare Binder‚Äù button triggers a snapshot (via react-native-view-shot) or shares a pre-generated image (expo-sharing).
	‚Ä¢	Gallery Navigation: If many pages, a thumbnail drawer at bottom or a page number input could quickly jump to pages.

Implementation: This is advanced but doable with React Native animations (e.g. using Reanimated 3D transforms). Placeholder content must be avoided: each slot is tied to actual card data or shows a dynamic placeholder silhouette via code.

8. Scanner & Pre-Grader
	‚Ä¢	Card Scanning Camera: A dedicated screen using expo-camera. Show live camera feed with a semi-transparent overlay: everything blurred/darkened except a centered rectangular frame matching standard card aspect ratio. The frame guides alignment. If in auto-scan mode, once a card is stable in frame (~2 seconds), automatically capture. If in manual mode, tapping anywhere takes a picture.
	‚Ä¢	On-the-fly Value Display: As cards are scanned (one by one), overlay a small panel showing each detected card‚Äôs name and estimated value. Maintain a running total of scanned cards‚Äô value at bottom. Use non-intrusive slide-in animations for each detected card result.
	‚Ä¢	Session Actions: After scanning, show a summary list of cards found with checkboxes or options ‚ÄúAdd to main collection‚Äù / ‚ÄúAdd to [Custom Lot]‚Äù. Allow quick toggling of add (for sell/trade lots). Then ‚ÄúDone‚Äù or ‚ÄúSave to Collection‚Äù button finalizes.
	‚Ä¢	Pre-Grading Mode: Toggle to Grading mode. The overlay frame stays, but UI instructions appear: ‚ÄúTake photo of front‚Äù, ‚ÄúTake photo of back‚Äù, ‚ÄúTake photo of top edge‚Äù, etc., with outlines for each position. A vertical list of empty thumbnail slots indicates required photos (Front, Back, Corners). As user captures each (auto or tap), fill that slot with a thumbnail. When all required views are captured in acceptable quality, enable a ‚ÄúSubmit for Pre-Grading‚Äù button.
	‚Ä¢	Grading Report UI: After submission, display a detailed report (like TAG Grading website): for each criterion (centering, corners, edges, surface), a slider/score and textual analysis. Show final estimated grade for PSA, BGS, etc. Include pop-out images with highlights of flaws (per TAG‚Äôs sample reports).

Citing Method: While implementing card recognition is complex, note that open-source examples use ML models (e.g. YOLO with perceptual hashing Ôøº Ôøº). Expo can use TensorFlow.js or offline ML for this. The UI must guide the user through scanning in real time ‚Äì lean on visual and haptic feedback (vibrate on successful capture).

9. Market & Portfolio
	‚Ä¢	Market Overview: A tab or screen summarizing trending cards and market news. Show a carousel or grid of ‚ÄúHot Movers‚Äù (cards with big price changes). Tapping one opens its detail. Include overall market index: e.g. total Pokemon TCG market cap chart.
	‚Ä¢	Card Market Search: Within Card Detail (as above), and also allow searching any card for price. Include historical price graphs and compare multiple marketplaces (TCGPlayer, Cardmarket, eBay).
	‚Ä¢	Personal Portfolio: Show the user‚Äôs entire collection value vs. cost: a pie chart (by set or by franchise), and line chart of collection growth over time. List highest-value cards. Display ‚ÄúGain/Loss‚Äù in current vs purchased value.
	‚Ä¢	Marketplace Listings: In Card Detail or Portfolio, allow tagging cards for sale/trade. The UI should show a price slider or input for listing price, along with market suggested price. Then optionally display aggregated listings (through APIs/eBay) so user can preview what others ask for similar cards.
	‚Ä¢	Alerts: Provide toggles in settings to alert when a card‚Äôs price crosses thresholds.

Implementation: Charts by Victory. Real-time pricing from APIs (pokeTCG, TCGPlayer, Cardmarket). We‚Äôll cache values (RTK Query with polling).

10. Search Functionality
	‚Ä¢	Global Search: Accessible from Home; a live-search that filters all cards across sets (via multi-key queries: e.g. ‚ÄúCharizard OR Mewtwo‚Äù). Show autocomplete of card names.
	‚Ä¢	Advanced Filtering: The ‚ÄúSort & Filter‚Äù panel must support Lucene-style compound queries (e.g. name:Charizard AND rarity:Secret). The UI can allow building advanced filters step-by-step (add criteria), or even accept text queries.
	‚Ä¢	Search History: Display past searches below search bar (optional future feature).

Implementation: Use a debounced text input. Leverage backend (or client-side indexed data) for multi-criteria search. UI: show filter chips for active filters.

11. Social/Community & News
	‚Ä¢	News Feed Tab: Aggregate RSS/API feeds from Pok√©Beach, Serebii, Bulbapedia, etc. Present as a scrollable list of headline cards (image + title + source). Tapping opens in-app webview (or browser). Include icons for each source.
	‚Ä¢	Social Feed (Future/Conceptual): A user-generated feed: each post can include images of new cards or binders, comments, likes. UI similar to Instagram feed: card posts with like/comment icons. Users can follow others, see public collections. (This requires backend; can stub with dummy posts for design.)
	‚Ä¢	Profile/Community: Show friend list, trade requests (in-app chat with Gifted Chat), wishlist-sharing.

Implementation: For now, news can be static JSON or scraped content. Chat via Firebase or Hasura (outside scope).

12. Additional UI Considerations
	‚Ä¢	Dark Mode & Theming: The default design is dark background (deep navy/black) with vibrant card images and accent colors (Pok√©mon yellow, Magic blue, etc.). Provide automatic Light/Dark switch or system sync. All custom components should support both themes.
	‚Ä¢	Animations & Feedback: Every tap or navigation should have subtle animation: e.g. tab icon highlight, button press ripple, page fade. Use Reanimated or built-in pressable animations. Haptic feedback on actions like adding card to collection (via expo-haptics).
	‚Ä¢	Accessibility: Support dynamic text sizes (scaling fonts), ensure color contrast, and labels for VoiceOver. Use accessible components from libraries (Paper, etc.) that handle screen readers.
	‚Ä¢	Responsiveness: UI should adapt to different screen sizes (mobile vs tablet vs web). Use flexible grids and media queries via React Native for Web if needed. For web, a sidebar or top nav might replace mobile tabs.
	‚Ä¢	No Placeholder Text: All screens should display real or dummy but realistic data. Avoid any ‚ÄúComing Soon‚Äù or lorem ipsum. For design mockups, use real card names/stats fetched from APIs. Any errors or empty states should have contextual messages (e.g. ‚ÄúNo cards found‚Äù instead of generic ‚ÄúError‚Äù).

Competitive Features & AI Enhancements

To surpass competitors like Collectr, DeckLab Bolt must offer unique, advanced tools:
	‚Ä¢	AI Deck Builder: Though not final, consider adding a deck-building module. AI can suggest deck improvements or combinations based on collection and meta. Integrate with online deck databases (e.g. LimitlessTCG) or use GPT to analyze user‚Äôs deck for suggestions.
	‚Ä¢	AI Assistant (‚ÄúAgentic‚Äù UX): Implement an in-app assistant (chatbot) that can answer user queries (e.g. ‚ÄúFind me all promo Pikachu in my collection‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlert me if Charizard hits $1000‚Äù). Following modern UX trends, we can allow voice/text conversational commands (see UX research Ôøº). This would make the app ‚Äúagentic‚Äù ‚Äì proactive and personalized. For example, a chat-style help screen that guides through scanning or filtering tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Predictive UX: The app could learn user patterns to pre-load data. For instance, if a user often checks a specific set, preload it. Or predict price interests (like ProCreator‚Äôs ‚ÄúPredictive UX‚Äù tips Ôøº) and surface insights before user asks.
	‚Ä¢	Competitive Player Tools: Provide deck performance analytics, meta-tracking (top tournament decks), and in-app tournaments scheduler. Offer ‚Äúpile suggestions‚Äù (similar to TopDecked for MTG) for deck improvement. Interface could include card synergy graphs or type coverage charts.
	‚Ä¢	Unified Experience: Ensure consistency across all modules (same component library, color scheme, typography). Use a design system approach (atomic components) so search results, lists, and forms look cohesive. For example, use the same Card component for news articles, sets, and search results (with props).

By combining these elements‚Äîstate-of-the-art libraries, Apple-inspired design flair, and intelligent features‚ÄîDeckLab Bolt‚Äôs UI will not only meet but exceed the competition. Every screen will be fully functional with live data (no placeholders or stub data), smooth animations, and an addictive polish that keeps collectors engaged.

Sources: Popular React Native UI frameworks and design guidelines Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº informed these recommendations. All libraries mentioned are open-source and Expo-compatible, aligning with the latest best practices.

the app will track search history data to apply it analytically to the app the search panel will have a tabbed view for the main screen which shows top cards cards searched in the app over time by most popular to least on an infinite scroll that goes through the entire database so we can track most popular card ever on the app etc to make this a more powerful application and to further improve it. The next tab will have the Sets with their images from the databases and users can click right into a set and display the entire set list quickly and filter and sort from their and use the infinite scroll until the set list is done. The first displayed will always be the most searched/most popular and  they will filter/sort from their, the last tab is the Pok√©dex feature that should resemble a Pok√©dex and you can toggle the show on and off if users need so you can either see all pokemon or make it more gamified to see what cards users add it to their collection or the app it will have the amount of cards that pokemon has and display how many you have collected to add to the achievements properly and make The app useful for search and then have that collector usefulness to track progress and to enhance the experience. The app will keep metrics on all rarities of cards like holo, full art, V, Vmax, Gold stars, etc by specific rarities and collections that users consider as fanatics! We are to make this app not only Practiacal, easy to use but also very agentic and useful to organize collections. You will add that type of sorting feature to the binder collection as well to help organize the collection in powerful ways because every fan has their own dream setup or collection and the binder feature is like a proud visual display tool that is the whole point of collecting to be in awe of the artwork and beauty in your own organized madness as to say. I want you to double check and ensure the AI personal assistant is a full full AI that is focused on the helping the users with questions on cards by price, market analysis, projection of card popularity or price on market stats and last sold  or the TCG sport as well, also it should be able to make binders based on what the user asks for and it should be as Helpful and amazing as Chat GPT where it listens to the users full request without ineruptions and then answers or resolves the users request within the app, like if I said ‚Äúmake me a binder of all cards (or cards in a portfolio collection/custom set that the user creates) in my collection by color‚Äù  things that buyers and sellers can do to display their cards in an organize way to be visually pleasing and easy to find by user request. It can even be complex like ‚ÄúOrganized my binder by Highest value and by color (specific colors like red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet or any combinations of them)‚Äù  we have all the assets and resources/databases to make this happen so that the main search should always be persistent at the top at all times will be a search that will work like a google search bar and is predictive when typing a name it will predict it from the databases by most popular or most recent at the top of that when the user builds a history and show last 7 searched but only 5 search items will show max users must scroll down to find more options if any.  Users can even use the pictures of the cards they scanned into the app to be displayed in the binder like front and back to enhance it to make it real life and more fun experience but the default will be the card image from the databases 
 Index entire code base and then begin systematically until complete

make sure everything is completed in terms of percentage so you can ensure its 100% done make sure update and analyze things in terms of completeion to 0%-100% make sure to use these resources to add graidents and rounder corners and any of the ui libraries needed to update the UI to look better than our competitors and to give our and amazing look and feel please look at how everything is presented and viewed and layout of it logically and the features that have been impleeented in the screenshots look at them analytically and comprehensively to understand further the proper look and feel and proper utilization of purpose and metrics and useability and power of the app. its very comlex build and i know we have a good foundation to perfect to make it look like a native ios app feel to rival the best award winning design apps. if you can find other projects on https://github.com/ to use as a UI reference and structure or to utilzie any function or ability anything to enhance any of the features above or you find in this project. make sure all api request, fetches, and endpoints are succesfull and all assests are properly utilized i prefer to use google gemini ai to handle the agentic feature base as its mainly free if we use the flash model and it has all the capabilites needed for processing and finding and help users function the app to the full capabilities making sure the Personal Card assistant is what we will name and abbreviate it as PCA as a nickname as this helps brand DeckLab and we can transform it to be called DeckLabA.I. even because it will be utilized as a powerful app for pokemon information since its the most popular TCG and even VGC games played competitively, even hobby collecting is a sport. i want you to create advanced documentation for our appstore release and just proper developer/business documentation so we can market and check our app build to be scaled to take over the market. this is a professional build. please organize the directory of any loose documentation files as i dont have a Docs folder for all of this. i need more orgnized and detail documenation that fully explains everything above to the max and without leaving any detail out so i cover all bases of communicating this app in anyway ever again. I have given you so much context and i expect you to handle all of these taske effieciectly and effectively to the max full potential to ensure the best implementaion please list out all the competitor features from the ones i listed above as i will re iterate now to their latest most current build you can use Web to find app store listing and analyze screenshots, build releases, and any resources they state to use in the app. you will make proper documentation for all of that as well so i never have to communicate or tell you about it or any other person about it as well we have it locally in this so we know our strengths and weaknesses. i know we have many strengths right now but they are not fully implemented and are not fully functional and not everything is united and properly handled with the advanced look feel and usuability as the other apps that are dominating the market. approach this as the most amateur build youve ever seen and please make the best improvements strictly following my vision ive given you and the current features in my build to further take this build to the next level. Assume that not everything has been hooked up or all screens are made or it looks good in anyway i expect a complete enhancement of the application especially the UI the most the features are well underway its just making sure they are implemented in the most advanced way and not in a quick rush amateur code. you are a senior coding engineer and now the project manager you are everyone on the Developer team and you will handle all tasks as if it were delegated by the top software and coding company standard in 2025 for user desing and functionality like Apple or even gaming companies like Sony, nintendo and even AI companies like OpenAI, deepseek, Groq, Google Gemini, Ollama. we are to maintain that we keep driving improvements to the max output and make this the most efficient easy to use logical purposful powerful, quickest app in every bench mark . the api calls dont seem to work as no information is being displayed. also i want the collections and binder to live in the same tab where users can manage their default portfolio,custom lots and binder collections all in one. i find having the two seperate tabs for them to be redundant also i notice a debug button that serves the user no purpose in the search tab that should be moved inside the settings panel for dev use. also when cards are shown it shows them so big and takes up a lot of the screen i want them to be smaller and display more market information for the card thats important to the user. like Damage,Moderately played, light played, Near mint, and then PSA graded 10 prices are usually the most important information so if you can display Damaged, Near mint/NM, and then PSA 10 prices below the card and adjusting the card image size would truly make it next level and look and have purposeful logic. also the app takes a long time to load and find data please run benchmarks and makes this applicaiton smooth fast and usuable. make sure all assets are being loaded in just like how they should be sticking to our vision use @Web to deep research and get the best resolution and to improve and enhance our app more with knowing all of this. you are to index reveiw and refine all files if needed and its reccomeneded. focus on making sure that everything works. also i did not see the onboarding screen when i loaded the app took me straight to the homepage. for new users it should be onboarding with an option to skip or do later, sign in if the user whiches to create a profile to save data, and then the home screen which should be default search. also the ai assistant should be handled as a quick toggle button that users can press anytime and ask a question like a google assistant or chat gpt and either talk to it or type what the users wants the answer for or create a custom lot/binder collection if needed please insure this functionality is 100% working and implemented properly as well. make sure to review intial app description i gave you and all references so you have as much context as possible to ensure we dont miss anything.
